# Permutations
To demonstrate using permutations of a password to brute force an API.

You have forgotten your password to an API,but you remember that it was a combination of the following :
- It contained upper and lower case latters
- You sometimes substitute a with @,s with 5 and o with 0

Using the clues, you decide to write a function that can generate all possible combinations of your passwords and then run each one against your target api.
